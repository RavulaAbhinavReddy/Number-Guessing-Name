# Number-Guessing-Name
The "number guessing game" or "guess the number game" is a classic and simple game where the player attempts to guess a randomly selected number within a predefined range. It's a popular beginner programming exercise due to its simplicity and the opportunity it provides to practice basic programming concepts like conditionals, loops, and user input/output.

The game typically involves the following steps:

The computer selects a random number within a specified range.
The player is prompted to guess the number.
The player's guess is compared to the randomly selected number.
Based on the comparison, the player receives feedback (e.g., "too high," "too low," or "correct guess").
The process repeats until the player either guesses the number correctly or runs out of attempts.
